# Exploring Model agnostic methods using  RED WINE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
Herewe try to explore different interpretable model learning techniques and what features are driving to predict a particular class. We included some of the model interpretable methods such as Permutation importance, Dependency plot, LIME, and SHAP to analyse feature weights and their importance. These methods will help us to interpret why model has taken certain decision
