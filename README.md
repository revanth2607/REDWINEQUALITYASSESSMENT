# REDWINEQUALITYASSESSMENT
Herewe try to explore different interpretable model learning techniques and what features are driving to predict a particular class. For instance, in our project, we can say features like high alcohol values; low pH plays a crucial role in predicting the good quality wine and likewise other classes. We included some of the model interpretable methods such as Permutation importance, Dependency plot, LIME, and SHAP to analyse feature weights and their importance. These methods will help us to interpret why model has taken certain decision.
The dataset in this study comes from UCI Machine learning repository [U] utilised data in a wine quality study that was previously accepted by the Kaggle web-based platform.The dataset included the information of 6497 different type of white and red and wine quality observations. But in this research our main focus is on red wine quality so, the red wine quality related observations which consist 1599 records in it and it included clustered details about type, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol
